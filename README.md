# NeuroSymbolic-Recursive Reasoning System

A research implementation combining neural-symbolic integration with recursive refinement for advanced reasoning tasks. This project represents an iterative approach to building AI systems that can both learn from data and reason with explicit logical constraints.

## Overview

Modern AI systems excel at pattern recognition but often struggle with logical reasoning and interpretability. Conversely, symbolic AI systems provide transparent reasoning but lack the flexibility to learn from data. This project integrates both approaches through a recursive refinement architecture where neural and symbolic components work together iteratively to solve reasoning problems.

The system architecture consists of four primary components: a neural reasoner that learns patterns and proposes solutions, a symbolic verifier that checks solutions against logical constraints, a refinement engine that coordinates recursive improvement cycles, and a metacognitive controller that makes strategic decisions about the reasoning process. Unlike traditional neural networks that generate outputs in a single forward pass, this system iteratively refines its hypotheses through multiple cycles of proposal, verification, and improvement.

The key innovation is deep supervision across refinement steps. Rather than providing training signal only on final outputs, the system receives feedback at each intermediate refinement stage. This encourages the neural component to learn trajectories of progressive improvement rather than simply memorizing input-output mappings. The symbolic component provides hard constraints that prevent logically invalid solutions while generating specific feedback to guide refinement.

## Key Features

The system implements several important capabilities that distinguish it from conventional approaches. Neural-symbolic integration allows pattern recognition and logical reasoning to enhance each other bidirectionally. The neural component learns to internalize common logical patterns while the symbolic component provides verification and explanation. Recursive refinement with deep supervision enables progressive solution improvement through multiple reasoning cycles, with training signals at each stage encouraging meaningful intermediate steps.

The architecture provides interpretability through explicit reasoning traces that show how solutions evolve through refinement cycles, which constraints were checked at each stage, and why certain proposals were accepted or rejected. The metacognitive controller adapts the reasoning strategy based on problem characteristics and component confidence, learning over time when to rely more heavily on neural intuition versus symbolic verification.

The implementation runs efficiently on standard hardware without requiring GPUs for small to medium scale problems, though GPU acceleration is supported for larger models and datasets. The modular design with clear interfaces between components facilitates testing, modification, and extension of individual subsystems.

## Installation

The system requires Python 3.8 or higher. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. You can verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. You will also need pip for package management, which typically comes bundled with Python installations.

### Basic Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory. Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies from your system Python installation. On Linux and macOS, you can create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv` and activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`. On Windows, use `python -m venv venv` to create the environment and `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate it.

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using pip. The basic installation includes PyTorch for neural network operations, NumPy for numerical computations, and several utility libraries. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Requirements File Contents

The requirements.txt file should contain the following dependencies:

```
torch>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
pyyaml>=6.0
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
```

For CPU-only installations, PyTorch will automatically install the appropriate version. If you have a CUDA-capable GPU and want to leverage hardware acceleration, install PyTorch with CUDA support by visiting pytorch.org and using the installation command appropriate for your system configuration.

    time_budget=0.8
)

# Update based on performance
controller.update_weights(
    neural_confidence=0.85,
    symbolic_valid=True
)
```

## Common Tasks

### Save and Load Models
```python
from src.utils import save_checkpoint, load_checkpoint

# Save
save_checkpoint(
    model=model,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    epoch=10,
    metrics={'loss': 0.15},
    filename="my_model.pt"
)

# Load
checkpoint = load_checkpoint(
    "models/checkpoints/my_model.pt",
    model=model,
    device='cpu'
)
```

### Create Custom Rules
```python
from src.symbolic_component import Rule

def check_custom_rule(solution, puzzle, target):
    # Your custom logic here
    return solution.max() < 0.8

custom_rule = Rule(
    name="max_value_rule",
    description="Max value must be less than 0.8",
    check_fn=check_custom_rule,
    violation_encoding=4
)

verifier.add_rule(custom_rule)
```

### Visualize Results
```python
from training.visualize import plot_refinement_trajectory
import numpy as np

# After getting result
ground_truth = np.random.rand(9)
plot_refinement_trajectory(
    result=result,
    ground_truth=ground_truth,
    output_path="results/my_trajectory.png"
)
```

### Run Custom Training
```python
from training.train import DeepSupervisionTrainer
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Prepare data
train_data = TensorDataset(puzzles, solutions, targets)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=32)

# Create trainer
trainer = DeepSupervisionTrainer(
    model=model,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    num_refinement_steps=3
)

# Train one epoch
for epoch in range(10):
    metrics = trainer.train_epoch(train_loader, epoch)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: loss={metrics['train_loss']:.4f}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error: "No module named 'src'"
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd neurosymbolic-recursive

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### CUDA Out of Memory
```bash
# Edit config to use CPU or reduce batch size
# In configs/default_config.yaml:
system:
  use_gpu: false

data:
  batch_size: 16  # Reduce from 32
```

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Make sure all dependencies are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v -s

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_neural.py -v
```

### Training Too Slow
```bash
# Reduce training size
# In configs/default_config.yaml:
data:
  num_samples: 1000  # Reduce from 10000

training:
  num_epochs: 5      # Reduce from 20

- Use larger batch sizes (64-128)
- Increase hidden dimensions (256-512)
- More refinement steps (5-10)
- Longer training (50+ epochs)

### Memory Optimization
```python
# Use gradient accumulation
for i, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
    loss = trainer.train_step(*batch)
    
    # Accumulate gradients
    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```
